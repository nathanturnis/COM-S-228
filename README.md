# COM-S-228
Coursework from COMS 228 (Introduction to Data Structures) at Iowa State University

HW 1 - Project simulates interactions amoung different life forms in a plain. These life forms include a Fox, Badger, Rabbit, Grass, and Empty. Each cycle
updates the plain depending on the different rules of the surrrounding life forms. Ex: all life forms die at old age, more badgers kill foxes, rabbits eat
grass, etc. Program can generate random pains or plains from a file. Plains can be any width as long as they are the same width and height.

HW 2 - Project uses sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort) to sort an input set of 2D integer points. Program can
can take input from user or read from a file. It finds the median coordinate point, and displays the time each sorting algorithm took.

HW 3 - Project implements a stout list (a linked list where each node consists of an array of objects of type E) and its iterator methods. Some, but not all,
methods implemented include remove, add, set, next, etc. Program also uses Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort along with a comparator to sort the list. 

HW 4 - Project is able to decode files with binary-tree-based algorithm. Files ending in .arch are encoded with the first line or 2 consisting of a sequence
of letters, numbers, spaces, and characters. Third line and beyond of the file consists of the binary encription. Program uses binary trees to decode the
message and output it to the console.
